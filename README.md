# Scholarship Application System

This project involved developing a software application in a group of 6 for an introductory Software Engineering course. Our program was a fictional Scholarship Application system for students of the University of Calgary to use to view and apply for a variety of awards. Admin users could make edits to the awards database and select scholarship winners, who would then be notified through the system.
